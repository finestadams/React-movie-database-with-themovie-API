Various versions have evolved over the years, sometimes by accident, sometimes on purpose (injected humour and the like).</p>
                                <p className="section__text section__text--small">All the Lorem Ipsum generators on the <b>Internet</b> tend to repeat predefined chunks as necessary, making this the first true generator on the Internet. It uses a dictionary of over 200 Latin words, combined with a handful of model sentence structures, to generate Lorem Ipsum which looks reasonable. The generated Lorem Ipsum is therefore always free from repetition, injected humour, or non-characteristic words etc.</p>
